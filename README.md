My approach
-------

1) Create a Menu class that will show the menu
2) Create a ShopFront class that will allow the customer to see the menu
3) An order can then be placed using the argument (name, number)
4) A customer may make as many additions to the order as they wish
5) The shop then creates a total for the dishes
6) The user can check the price with what they think it should be
7) If the price is correct a message will be sent notifying them that the order will be with them in an hour


Problems
--------

1) The Twilio functionality was not working. The error stated that I could not send from the number I had given. I tried the 'Magic number' as per API docs but this didn't work either
